# Employee Manager

The backend is developed using Spring, featuring @Entity classes that map to MySQL database tables, and CRUDRepository implementations for data operations. Service classes encapsulate the core functionality, utilizing dependency injection to ensure a good communication between components.

The frontend, crafted with Angular, HTML, and CSS, offers an intuitive interface for users to add, modify, and delete employee records. It employs Angular features such as directives, two-way data binding, and custom event handling, allowing users to search for employees by name effortlessly. User interactions trigger requests to designated backend endpoints, where the application retrieves data and returns results for display.
